Fished our last day in the tuna zone and caught 21 bluefin tuna and 4 yellowfin tuna. Cant say their was a shortage of fish because they were everywhere. Just had lock jaw for the fleet.

With good sign of biting fish we stuck around again today and managed to capture a few more. We are off to a good start and hope to keep em coming.

We started off the trip at the Bait Receivers with some outstanding raffle prizes that were donated by some very generous company's. After traveling South for a couple of days, we were rewarded with excellent Yellowfin Tuna fishing. We got our daily limits and then proceeded for an overnight ride in search of Wahoo. It didn't take long before they started to bite. Several passengers were rewarded with their very first Wahoo. As a couple of them told me. their whole trip was made at that point. After the Wahoo drill we were off in search of Yellowtail. After another overnight ride we arrived at our destination. For the first hour or so it didn't look promising. but then it was like someone threw a light switch. It was as good as it could possibly get. Fly-lined Sardine. YoYo jigs, or surface iron; take your pick. Daily limits were easily obtained. We still had a full day of fishing left and it was decided to fish the coast for a relaxing day of Calico Bass fishing. We had a great time catching and releasing 3 - 5 lb bass throughout the day.
The best way to describe this trip was FUN,FUN,FUN. A personal thank you to Jeff and the entire Independence crew who performed with the expertise they are well known for.I would also like to thank all of the company's who generously donated there products for all to enjoy.I keep saying each year it can't get any better but it continues to prove me wrong.

It was very heartwarming to see friends on this trip that I had made during my 25 years in the sportfishing business. We had a great time talking about the good old days.
As far as the fishing went, Jeff could not have planned out a better course of action. The afternoon of departure we rolled down the coast a short distance and quickly put 90 nice grade Yellowtail aboard. That night we made some bait and woke up to some more good Yellowtail fishing. Mid-afternoon we started heading north so as to be in position for some Tuna. Before daylight Bluefin under the boat started biting and as you can imagine in the dark the crew had their hands full. By days end we had our daily limit. Next day, same song second verse; daily limits. Next day it was Dorado time and we were not disappointed. Some really nice grade fish. By days end it was time to call it a trip.

It is with a heart full of sadness that we inform you of the passing of Sam Lewis. For those that knew Sam you know how much he will be missed. For those of you that did not know Sam it's really to bad. A true gentleman in every sense of the word. Sam made 36 long range trips on the Independence and during that time made a lot of good friends. His personality was such that you immediately wanted to be a part of every thing he did on the boat. Every time he would get bit he would let out a yell that had the boat erupt with laughter. When he would sit down for dinner every one wanted to be at his table just to hear his stories. I could go on for hours with stories about Sam. I just want to say we will all miss you and I'm sure we will all meet again. God bless you Sam.

We had by far the best sign of tuna of the trip with fish blowing out all over the bank all day long even when the bite was off. Hot ticket was a native bait,Pufferfish,Flying-fish, Triggerfish and Skipjack(man bait) all were getting bit better than the Sardine. Water temperature was probably part of the reason with 82.5 degree water the last day and really making the dines sluggish when fished on big hook and line. The jigs also hooked a fair amount of fish in the predawn hours and after dark, Salas PL68 and Tady 15 again stole the show,the kite with both Squid and Flyers  accounted for lots of bites as well. Big fish of the day went to Paul Rubio with a 220 pound Yellowfin taken on an oceanic trigger fish. Most of the bigger fish taken were in the 130-180 pound range and there were lots of 30 to 60 pound fish filling the gaps.

Hello again from the independence. We had another super fun day fishing in the  u s a.  today. Things got going shortly after daylite , and the large bluefin put on a great show for us. 60 to 100 lb fish were the rule, and picture perfect weather made it even more enjoyable. Everyone had multiple chances at these trophy bluefin, and when the final one hit the deck we had tallied up 26 jumbo bluefin for the effort. Mix in a few casualties that normally occur with this caliber fish , but over all everyone did really well. We are having some difficulty sending all the pictures, but we will as soon as we can. At present the Mexican government has lifted the ban on fishing for bluefin tuna in Mexican waters, so this will be hugely beneficial to the San Diego fleet in the next few months. The sword fish spotter planes are still reporting huge volumes of bluefin still around down there, so don't be left out on this great fishery. By the way we have some openings on the coast side fishing 8 day coming up, check it out on the web. Sea ya soon, more reports to come. Jeff",70.0,73.5,79.0,0.0,10.0,12.0,29.94

2013-12-14,Thanksgiving Trip,"Just returned for a great trip.  Many thanks to all our sponsors: Westcoast Marketing-Rick Ozaki with his vast array of give-a-ways, Avet Reels, Seaguar, Graft-Tech, Raider jigs. (Hopefully I didn't anyone), Let me just say thanks.  Passengers were extremely happy. Our biggest cows for this trip were: (Not necessarily in order of weight) Robert O'Neil 213, Don Klahs 201, 210, Vlad Chernoguz 206, Gary Sturney 281, Sal Proetto 208.7, Leon Bundy 250.4, Joseph Solomon, 246.8, Cathy Needleman 336, Dane Barriault 224.2, 233, 238, Fred Lee 228, Ken Buzzell 235.2, 210, Dale Lethcoe 228, 212, 253.4,  17 cows total.

2013-12-12,Possible Women's Record with Cathy Needleman's 355 lb catch,"If Independence angler Cathy Needleman's 355-pound (by tape measurement, see yesterday's posting) tuna makes that mark when the boat arrives, Cathy will displace Judith Montague at the top of the list of ladies with 300-pounders. Montague won the jackpot for her 353.7-pounder taken aboard Red Rooster III in November 2008.

I know of four other women claiming yellowfin tuna of over 300 pounds. Joyce Corrigan had the best tuna of the Royal Polaris trip that returned January 20, 2004: a 310-pound yellowfin made ineligible by handling. The fish beat her previous best, a 304-pounder. During the early 1990s, June Pierce, fishing with her husband Larry aboard the Red Rooster III on an 18-day, 18-passenger limited load trip, caught a tuna of 305 pounds.

Gail Wade-Adams of Pleasant Hill fished with skipper Justin Fleck on a 2012 trip that visited Clarion Island and produced her 340.8-pound whopper. Her tuna slipped past a 315-pounder taken by Liz Franzino of Hemet. Liz won first place for her sardine-biter, caught on 80-pound line when she fished with Randy Toussaint on Royal Star one year earlier.
I have a suspicion I may have missed a deserving woman angler here, but I can't find her in my records. If I've forgotten a lady with a 300-pounder, please let me know.",47.0,57.35,67.0,0.0,10.0,9.0,30.24

2013-06-08,ETA & Points Four Future Interest,"Hello again from the independence, we are on our way home now, but we did stop this morning for some deep water table fare.  Good ling and red fishing put the icing on the cake. Here is a brief run down, and what worked best this week. As far as the offshore thing goes keep it simple. If the big rigs are around a good sound 50 or 60 lb outfit with the same pound floro and a 3/ 0 circle hook, I would start with the 60 lb when you first stop, and then  drop down only if you really have to.  If it is that school size yellowfin around then some 30 and 40 lb with floro is all you need. as far as the jigs  for the bft the jigs that worked best for us were salas 7x  and 6x   heavy, blue n white , and chrome n blue, or a tady 4 / 0  all tied to some 80 or 60 lb. One thing, leave the flimsy, light stuff at home, you need to pull on 'em, so stout rods are best, well balanced outfits are the rule. As far as  yellowtail fishing, it really doesn't get any easier on one of these trips, jigs, or bait, take your pick. I hope it helps out on the future trips.

When the dust cleared we tallied 44 fish before calling it quits. I have to congratulate everyone on board here for participating in this beautiful catch we have here, including the entire crew which plays a big part every trip. Productivity varied from day to day, some days were off the chart crazy good, and some were what we call really well. The slot size 170 lb to 190 lb fish were very abundant most every day, which made for some of the best fishing I have seen in a while.

2012-08-26,An unforgettable Dorado fishing experience from the Independence for Cindy Norred,"When the whopper bull dorado started jumping it was a long way off from the stern. It never stopped, even when it was in gaffing range. Montanan Cindy Norred had never been long range fishing, but by the fourth day of her seven-day trip aboard Independence she'd pulled in numerous yellowtail, along with some bluefin and yellowfin tuna as well as a couple of wahoo.

Shortly after lunch that day the Emergency Medical Technician and mother of two was flylining off the wide stern when the bull took her sardine and some serious excitement began. The leaper took her from port side to starboard , cruising the 32-foot width of Indy's stern several times, as it continued a great series of jumps, each followed by whooping from the 29 anglers watching the fight.

Every time the big bull jumped it came down on its flat sides with a flapping clap heard over the hoots and shouts of the anglers watching.
Tension soared when she pulled it boatside between the gate and the corner some ten minutes into the scrap. Then the stubborn mahi dived under the boat and came up on the port side, to the surprise of the fishermen there, and showed off its brilliant yellow with another series of leaps. When the gal from Big Fork tried to follow her fish around the stern her line was hung up under the hull, while it continued to perform its antics.

That brought skipper Jeff DeBuys down from the tank in a hurry, and with crewman Doug Brink on the end of the fork (a metal Y on the end of a gaff handle, meant for such situations) the pair managed to free the line connected to Cindy's dorado. The mono was badly frayed for several yards.

With a dexterous series of moves, DeBuys cut and spliced the frayed portion, and Cindy went back to work, following the obstreperous critter back and forth from starboard to port again. At last she coaxed it back to the boat, but it eluded the gaff once more with a rail-high jump.

The unforgettable scrap ended when the bull was gaffed aboard, videoed above and below the waterline. Cindy posed with Brink and DeBuys for a series of photos with the gorgeous mahi, a fish and an experience she isn't likely to forget. Her first sizeable dorado weighed in at 41.2 pounds on the scales at Pt. Loma Sportfishing when Independence returned August 25, and won third place in the jackpot.",0.0,65.26,75.0,0.0,10.0,14.0,29.93

2012-05-04,Report by Rick Ozaki,"Here is a of West Coast Mkt / Avet reels on April 16 day trip.

     The first annual April 16 day trip in on the Independence was a great success.  In my 20 years of fishing 16 days trips or longer this was the best wahoo fishing I have every had.
The quality of the wahoo were between 25 lbs to 45 lbs with a few over 50ls.  Jim Mann, a regular on this charter caught the largest wahoo at 65 lbs  The hot ticket was the gold Raider in pink and the chrome in blue.  Most of the wahoo were caught in the buffer zone at Clarion Island.
     The tuna bite was also sensational.  We caught them on jigs (early morning), chunks, sardines, mackerel and especially the kite.  During the trip we went through 6 rotations of the kite.
The hot kite setup was the new 3-speed 80 Avet.  Avet donated two of these reels for kite fishing.  We probably caught over 100 tuna (many over 200 lbs) on these reels.  Everybody just loved the grinding power of the 3 speeds.  Many of the anglers never used the lowest gear because the middle gear did the job just fine.  We ended up with between 18-20 cows for the trip.  Jim Chivas caught the largest tuna at 243 lb   I also wanted to congradulate Elmer Lackey for winning the final Holdem Poker championship.
    I wish to thank Mark and Paul for setting this trip up for me and to the Captain and crew for during a terrific job (Captain Jeff, Paul M., Ed, Meschel, Dough, Matt, Kevin and Oscar).
Our sponsors were Avet Reels, Yozuri , Seaguar, Graftech Rods, Raider Lures,and 5 star Fish Processing.  Special thanks to my dear friend RIchard Hightower.  Also thanks to Dave Rocchi, Dalte Lethcoe, Tony de Kruif and Norm for helping me on the trip
     Next year's trip is a private charter by West Coast Marketing.  The trip is sold out but Mark and Paul just added another 16 day limited load in late April 2013",59.0,62.93,67.0,0.0,10.0,14.0,30.08
2012-04-29,Introductory Overnight SFR Charter Aboard the Independence,"The  Independence is now running introductory overnight trips out of 2second Street Landing in San Pedro. The Independence just returned from a 16 day trip and you could almost feel the adrenaline still lingering from the previous anglers who called this beautiful vessel their home and fished as far south as Puerto Vallarta for cow tuna. Once a year the Independence runs introductory trips allowing passengers to check out the boat to see what they're in for when they book a long range trip. Our SFR overnight charter aboard the Indy was a blast! Captain Mark Pisano welcomed everyone aboard, gave us an overview of the amenities the Indy offers, and kicked off the safety speech followed by what to expect fishing San Clemente Island. Our sponsored raffle prizes included SFR Shirts,  Seaguar Fluorocarbon and Owner Hooks.
We were all well rested and woke up to an incredible breakfast prepared by Ed and Rollo at San Clemente Island. We had an assortment of Rockfish with several nice Sheephead and Lingcod mixed in. Captain Pisano put us on a few nice drifts and we dropped the anchor at several spots that yielded an occasional bass. We all had a memorable experience, we fished hard and really enjoyed our day aboard the Indy. The long range fishing experience is must for every serious angler. The comfort and amenities aboard the Indy are truly amazing. Checkout their website or better yet just call Judy at (619) 226-6006 and get it done. You won't regret it!

Every day was action packed, as things would get going before daybreak, and end into the night. The first 3 days were the real stand outs, as we were filling up fast, and then the last 4 days were more civil, 30 to 40 fish a day. There were shots at big ones every day, and we made the most of every chance, with possibly 14 cows up to maybe 277 lbs  For the most part the rest of the fish is a beautiful grade, 125 to 195 lbs  With a few bigger, and a few smaller. All methods worked, as there was something for everyone, chunk, sardine, man bait (skipjack), jigs, you name it, at the right time it worked. We are headed up the line now, most recovering from the battles with these brutes, and some watching movies, some comparing stories from the trip.

We spent our time down in the southern fishing zones, and were not disappointed with the fishing and the weather. Every day was different, as one day it was 130 lb to 200 lb fish, and the next day it was mixed up 100 to 180 lb fish. I would have to say that every method worked this trip. If you were planning to try this in the near future, I would recommend more 100 lb outfits, and a 130 lb for good measure. The sardines were the hot ticket, as at times we would have 8 to 13 fish going, and other times 3 to 5 going. We had quite a few anglers that had not fished for these big tuna before, and after day 1 they were tuned in, and were doing very well for the rest of the trip. As I said before, the weather was absolutely gorgeous, with flat seas. Taking a quick survey, I would have to say at least half of our anglers caught their personal best this trip. One angler that comes to mind is Martha Parker, who weighs maybe 95 lbs, now she put on a clinic one day, as she landed 5 of these brutes one day, all personal bests.

The 6 to 8 day trip gives many options to make a quality catch. Please look at the dates as many of the trips depart on a weekend so a five-day workweek is taken up on most of the 6 to 8 day trips.

What worked and what did not. Fishing for Wahoo, the Raider jigs were hands down the hottest irons that we used, gold worked best with silver being second best. 50 lb mono on a good 2-speed reel like an Avet JX, LX or HX and a 610-type rod. Fishing the Tuna you really need a 2-speed reel with 40 and mostly 50-pound mono. We do have loaner rod and reel combos onboard for those who need them. We also carry jigs and line on the boat. On another note we have some spots on September 6 and 7-day days that will target this area. Please give us a call if you have any Questions.",64.0,65.6,70.0,0.0,10.0,12.0,29.93

The weather was 25 knots of wind and a close together steep chop, had the weather been good who knows but I have to think it would have been much better.

They had about 140 mixed fish with a few stand-out yellows up to 45 pounds and a few bigger tuna as well. They took off and are headed up the line to try a day at one of the islands to try to finish off on there limits of yellowtail and then fish the last full day offshore for albacore and bluefin.

2009-06-16,Independence Sportfishing - Current Conditions 6/16/09,"Hello everyone, The e-mail onboard the boat is still down. I did however talk to captain Jeff Debuys tonight and this is his report for the first two days of fishing. They headed down toward alijos and in route to the rocks looked at an area that had some signs of albacore and bluefin tuna. The wind was up a bit in the 15 to 18 range, they did not have a whole lot to work on as 3 yellowfin tuna and one albacore in the 20 pound range were all they had to show for their efforts. The gang arrived at the rocks at noon and had very good action on yellowtail with many in the 30 to 45 pound range, along with 18 yellowfin tuna most in the 35 to 55 pound range, the biggest being 90 pounds. Today however the tuna bit much better with 85 beautiful yellowfin hitting deck of the Independence, most of which again were 30 to 55 pounds. The yellowtail also made a good showing thoughout the day and 130 fish were tagged, many of which in the 30 to 45 pound bracket. The weather has been about 15 knots and choppy seas but during the course of the day the wind backed off until they had to use a balloon on the kite to keep it flying. Jeff said they are planning to spend another day doing the same and see how it goes, he did mention the Excel on a 5 day trip had 80 mixed albacore and bluefin today and wants to check that out for at least one if not 2 days on the way home. The 7 and 8 day trips this year have seen some great fishing and are really the best valued trips we offer. Next season's schedule will be up in the next week, so if you want to plan on fishing one of these trips with us next year check back and give us a ring for more info.

2009-05-02,SFR INDEPENDENCE 2-DAY TRIP: SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND,"The SFR 2 day charter aboard the Independence on
May 2-3 was a big success.Thirty-two anglers jumped at the chance to fish aboard the impressive Independence Sportfisher, with San Clemente Island the backdrop for a 2 day Island freelance trip. With the weather up and the outer islands blown out, Captains Mark Pisano, Paul Strasser and Jeff BeBuys determined that San Clemente Island held the most potential for a successful catch. Day 1 saw us start out on some of the deeper water structures around the island in search of some tasty rockfish. Numerous big lingcod, red snapper and other assorted rockfish were hauled up and sacked up by the anglers aboard. We moved in tight to the kelp for some shallow water surface fishing that saw a few calicos caught as well as a nice 13 1/2 lb flatty by yours truly that took day 1 jackpot honors. Ed Lacombe cooked up an awesome NY steak dinner that sent everyone to bed happy and full, anticipating the next days action. Day 2 had us fishing in tight along the kelp beds in hopes of some surface action. We had several good pops on the calico bass including a number of those famous San Clemente toads that we all love to catch so much. SFRs John Thompson pulled a nice flatty out of the kelp to take day 2 jackpot honors. We finished the day off in a little deeper water, filling up the sacks with a few more tasty rockfish before  calling it a trip and heading for the landing. I can't say enough about the Independence Crew and the lengths they go to insure a good time by all. Truly a top notch professional operation all the way around. Check the Independence website at independencesportfing.com for their full schedule and don't forget about the upcoming 5 day SFR trip in July.

2009-03-15,Don,"A summer trip offers anglers fishing possibilities unmatched by any other, with albacore, bluefin, yellowtail and even dorado and yellowfin tuna in the catch. Six days in August means the skipper's options will include fishing anywhere from 50 miles out of San Diego to nearly 500. On a trip like this one, you could wake up to fish a new species in a new location every day!

Join Bill Roecker on a very special six-day Rusty Hook trip aboard Independence. The Indy will depart from Pt. Loma Sportfishing Monday August 10, returning on Sunday the 16th. Many of Bill's sponsors will donate fishing products for use by everyone on the trip, including jigs, line, fluorocarbon and hooks, and there will be many raffle prizes, enough so that everyone will win one or two. Bill will give each angler aboard the Indy a DVD, a calendar, and a copy of the new DVD he and Paul Sweeney will shoot on the adventure.
Donated prizes will include an Accurate reel, a Seeker rod, fishing prints by Peter J, Newport artist, clothing from AFTCO, and dozens of others from Mustad, Salas, Seaguar, Tady, Catchy Tackle, Zucker's, Line One and other manufacturers. The list of donors and products will grow as the time for fishing draws near.
The fishing at the peak of the season should be as good as the prizes. The warm areas will have tropical species in August, and the predictions for a cool water year locally mean that albacore and possibly even big bluefin tuna may be targeted. With six days, the skipper will have all options open, to venture as far south as Alijos Rocks. It could be the best trip of the summer!
You'll want to sign up soon for this fabulous fishing excursion aboard the 112 x 32-foot Independence, before all the spots are gone. The Indy is one of the fleet's best, newest, most comfortable boats. She's well-skippered by four experienced captains, and her crew is knowledgeable and polite, ready to help you connect to the fish of a lifetime, and to assist you in getting that fish aboard. You'll enjoy excellent meals, served at the table in your booth, and you'll sleep in a spacious stateroom in air-conditioned comfort.
So hop on the Indy for a great trip with Bill Roecker! For more info, contact office manager Judi Collins at www.IndependenceSportfishing.com or call (619) 226-6006. This is a good one, don't let it get away!",55.0,56.84,59.0,0.0,10.0,12.0,30.16

a few new trips for the 09 season.  We have added some 6 and 7 day
trips for the summer which will give us the chance to go further if
need be to insure the best fishing possible.  This will allow us to
fish spots like Alijos Rocks and the Ridge as well as some of the
other areas not normally fished on the 5 day trips, this can also give
us more time at spots like Guadalupe island.  The last few years have
seen some very good fishing for yellowfin tuna and wahoo at these
lower areas during the summer and fall months.  On another note, we
have set our 2009 prices based on $4.00 per gallon for fuel and
sincerely hope we do not have to impose a fuel surcharge as we had to
do this year. In 2007 we did not charge a fuel surcharge until very
late in the year when fuel started to really jump up.  Fuel has become
our biggest expense in running a long range operation.  As many of you
that have fished with us know, we are not afraid to burn fuel to find
good fishing. I still think the San Diego long range fleet is a very
good value price wise compared to most of the other vacation options
available in today's economic times. With the price of today's fresh
wild caught fish being as high as $25 dollars a pound for Ahi and no
less than $15 dollars a pound for most other wild caught fish, you can
see the value in the fleets' trips. Thanks for all your support in the
past and in the future. Good Luck to all and we hope to see you soon.

2008-04-26,Independence Sportfishing - SFR San Clemente Island Trip,"We had a fantastic time on our SFR overnight trip aboard the beautiful Independence out of 2second Street Landing in San Pedro. This trip sold out in only a few hours at the Fred Hall Show in Long Beach and if you've ever experienced this vessel, you know why! It's not often that you run across an opportunity for an overnight trip on one of the Long Range fleet's finest vessels. Captains Mark Pisano and Paul Strasser ran a few introductory trips allowing anglers to have a preview of the Independence.

We fished San Clemente Island giving the exotics a solid effort in the morning and then loaded up on some nice Rockfish. The weather and conditions couldn't have been better as thirty-two anglers indulged in gourmet meals, phenomenal service, and luxurious comfort aboard the Indy. They will be kicking off the season out of San Diego with plenty of trips ranging from 3 to 16 days. To book an unforgettable fishing experience, call 619-226-6006.

2012-04-27,The Independence returns from the Avet/West Coast Marketing 16 Day charter with 19 Cows,"Independence skipper Jeff DeBuys was stoked with his trip, telling dock reporter Bill Roecker about it on the dock at Pt. Loma Sportfishing April 27, as his 24 anglers pulled tuna and wahoo to their numbered spots after the 16-day experience. Rick Ozaki chartermastered the Avet/West Coast Marketing adventure.

""The weather was just spectacular,"" remarked DeBuys. ""The best times were from noon until dark on most days, but they bit some at night, too. It looked like the fish were feeding on red crab and flying fish, from what we saw in them.  There's an awful lot of good water headed up this way,"" continued the skipper. ""We saw a strong uphill current and just flew home on it. We found a one-degree edge about 290 miles down. The warm side was over 65 degrees and there were bluefin there. They looked like 25-pounders.""

The group caught some 19 cows, or tuna over 200 pounds. The best one weighed 242 pounds, caught by Jim Chivas of Norwalk. He said the fish fought him for 45 minutes before it was gaffed aboard the Indy. He baited a sardine on a 6/0 Mustad Demon ringed circle hook, and used 130-pound Seaguar Premier fluorocarbon and 130-pound Spectra on a new Avet 80 reel and a Super Seeker 3 X 5 rod.

Dave Rocchi of Cypress won second place for a 239-pounder. He coaxed that one to the port bow after a half-hour tussle. His tuna bit a sardine on a 5/0 ringed Hayabusa hook on 100-pound Seaguar Premier fluorocarbon and 130-pound Line One spectra. He fished with an Avet HXW reel and a Calstar 665 XXH rod. He also had a 219-pound yellowfin.

Bill Nelson of Fairfield won third place for a 229-pound tuna. His sardine bait was pinned on a 7/0 Mustad Demon hook and 100-pound Seaguar Premier fluorocarbon, with 130-pound Kanzen spectra backing. He used a Penn 50 reel and a Seeker 6460 XXH rod to subdue the tuna after a fight of an hour and a half.

Les Nishi bagged a 224-pounder. Jim Isaac caught a brace of tuna that weighed 222 and 213 pounds. Paul Geurts had one at 219.6 pounds.

Dennis Saylor of Seal Beach bagged a triple, with his fish weighing in at 207, 203 and 201 pounds. He fished sardines on 4/0 ringed Owner Super Mutu hooks on 100-pound Momoi and 130-pound Line One spectra on an Avet Raptor reel and a Calstar 6465 XH rod.
Ev Combs of Palm Springs caught a 205-pounder with a squid under the kite. He said he used 10/0 Mustad 7691 hooks on one of the boat's kite rigs: 130-pound Izorline and 130-pound Izorline spectra, an Avet 80 reel and a Super Seeker 3 X 5 rod.

Chartermaster Rick Ozaki of Raider jigs and GrafTech rods got a brace, at 203 and 204 pounds. He said he baited sardines on 4/0 ringed Super Mutu hooks. He fished with 100-pound Seaguar Premier fluorocarbon and 100-pound Izorline spectra on an Avet HXW reel and a Calstar 770 XH rod.

Richard Berg got one at 201.8 pounds, and Dale Lethcoe snared a 201, as did Dane Barriault. Crewman Doug Brink gaffed his own 205-pound tuna, and chef Michelle, or ""Frenchie,"" as the boys call him, caught a 220-pound yellowfin.

The trip produced limits of tuna and wahoo, said skipper DeBuys. The best skin brought up to the scales was a 66-pound 'gator caught by Jim Mann of Bonita.  ""He bit on an orange and purple Marauder,"" said Mann, ""and he busted it.""

This was the Indy's last trip of the current big fish season. She will move up to 2second St. Landing for the next several weeks, and is expected to run short trips out to San Clemente Island and other local spots.",59.0,61.3,65.0,0.0,10.0,10.0,30.08

2008-09-23,Big Island Little Reels by Bruce Smith Shogun Skipper,The last couple of trips to Guadalupe Island have opened my eyes to some new effective techniques and the tackle that is used to compliment them To say things or the way we fish is changing is an understatement west coast anglers have always been at the forefront of tackle technology and innovation I believe live bait has a major role in what pushes us to find smaller tackle clearer monofilament and fluorocarbon composite rods and a mad scientist outlook of trying different approaches to present the most lively sardine or anchovy as far away from the boat as fast as possible In past articles I have named names and this will be no different There are products that I see that work and many that dont Fishermen enjoy hearing specifics although many times it doesnt matter what color of jig you use we want to hear what color is the hottest newest out there that magic bullet I am here to put out some new things that I have seen work on the water day after day Many times it will take years for a lot of us to come around to new techniques or materials but you have to understand also that captains and crews dont like to endorse hot new magic bullets until they see for themselves that they works under pressure Smaller smaller smaller reels when is it going to stop Not very soon I hope Accurate and Avet are leading the way to the small reel revolution If you havent picked up a small Accurate 870 or 665 two speed or Avet JX or LX now is the time to do it Hands down these reels are awesome fishing killing tools Ten years ago I was not too fond of Accurate reels there were some problems Today this opinion of mine has done a 180 degree flip and I fully endorse these little powerful two speed reels And no I am not getting paid to say this nor have I received compensation in any way Jack Nilsen and sons have come a long way and they have always pushed the two speed envelope with their innovative products and I really cant say enough good things about their new reels today Why should you go out and spend your pretty pennies on small reels Two words bait presentation Of course reels wont help you select that hottest sardine in the tray but they do allow that sardine to pull the spectra off your spool with a minimum of inertia and continued free spool This matters How much drag that is created between the spool and line in the water will determine how many bites you get What do we do We decrease the size or diameter of our lines spectra and the size and diameter of the reels or spools The hard part of doing all of this is to do it without sacrificing line strength or pulling power Secondly its a lot easier to tote around a smaller reel all day than it is a two speed 4 0 plain and simple And yes these diminutive monsters will do just that take the place of much of your bigger older tackle Third the two speed aspect of small reels was a big question mark when they came out Why would you need a two speed for 40 or 50 pound line much less for 30 Well for one thing not everyone and his uncle gets to fish off of Mag bay or Hurricane for a few weeks every winter Us working Joes spend our time at places like said Guadalupe island and Alijos rocks where the fishing can be less than wide open and we actually have to fish our baits away from the boat In situations like offshore bluefin fishing you have to use smaller diameter lines like thirty and forty to get a bite One thing in common with these locals is the size of the fish Guadalupe especially this year gives the five day angler a serious chance at getting that Holy Grail of a 100 pound yellowfin tuna Not that everyone is getting them in fact only a very small percentage are over 100 pounds right now but almost all of them are over 50 Now trying to get in a 70 pound yellowfin tuna with a single speed reel is a chore to say the least Do yourself a favor drop it in low and get that fish to the boat Next item of the day short top shots and Blackwater fluorocarbon Here is a slightly different take on things I am on the Blackwater pro staff but this is because I went to them and asked to work with their product since its so good As in previous articles I can say enough about the abrasion resistance of the Blackwater material but today I want to mention the elongation factor or simply put how much it stretches Yes Blackwater fluorocarbon stretches so put away your belief of pulled hooks because of short top shots of fluorocarbon No more feeling like you are fishing with a piece of wire attached to your spectra fluoro has come along way since its inception to be used for a fishing line Again I would like to state on how clear the BW material is Just hold up to the light of the tackle shop next to any other brand and you will be a believer For me personally clear lines help in getting bites whether its due to the fish actually have trouble seeing the color or the line or its just because I have more confidence in clear line the more clear the better Short top shots here I make a stand Many people will disagree Short top shots kick butt I love em What it comes down to is that I am as much of a gear head as the next guy and you have to be if you want to do these things right Seizing or crimping when used in conjunction with cyanoacrylate glue Zap a Gap Mega stick and no they are not all the same and there is room for improvement in this area both work well Hollow spectra for seamless connections that pass through your guides on the cast has helped immensely These are a couple things that are happening out here this late summer If you are not scheduled on a boat right now you may want to find an opening Guadalupe has been a lot of fun for the last two weeks and the Rocks are just that theyre rockin right now Fishing is good come out and enjoy it on any one of the fine long range boats that run out of San Diego Big Fish Happen Bruce A Smith Note Bruce and Shelly
